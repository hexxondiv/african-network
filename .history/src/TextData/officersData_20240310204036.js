      "Our seven research themes span the full range of research activities being carried out in the Laboratory and reflect national research priorities. Many themes cover the work of more than one research group, encouraging new associations and cross-disciplinary collaboration. While the core of our research programme is in experimental physics, essential theoretical support is provided by theorists embedded within the astrophysics and high energy physics research groups, while the condensed matter theory group are strongly cross-disciplinary and contribute to most of the themes shown above.",
