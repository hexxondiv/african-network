        <h6>Background and Focus:</h6>
        <p>
          <strong>Ubuntu and Education for African Development</strong> is an
          international group of scholars interested in Africa’s development. It
          is organized in a network whose intention is to promote, disseminate,
          and stimulate high quality research in economic, management, and
          development studies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seeds of Managing{" "}
          <strong>Ubuntu and Education for African Development</strong> were
          planted by Professor Vincent Asogwa during the 5th Aalborg University
          Conference whose theme was Finding Solutions to the New Challenges of
          Internationalization held at Comwell Rebild Bakker, Aalborg-Denmark
          4-6 June 2014. It was agreed by the inaugural group that there is lack
          of research on Africa made by African researchers. It was also agreed
          that it is important to strengthen research capacities and North-South
          partnerships.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, the network will serve as a meeting and communication
          forum for all its subscribers resident in Africa and elsewhere. It is
          a network for exchange of knowledge on an international level and
          constitutes machinery allowing for a better dissemination of
          information on research, teaching and outreach. The network also aims
          at the development of relations with all other professional and
          research-oriented networks that are active in the field of economics,
          management and development.

        <h4>Guiding Philosophy</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>None of us is greater than all of us.</li>
          <li>I am because we are; I can only be a person through others.</li>
          <li>Each of us needs all of us.</li>
          <li>An injury to one is an injury to all of us.</li>
          <li>
            Mutual respect is important because my humanity is bound up with
            yours.
          </li>
          <li>The whole affects the part as much as the part affects the whole.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Operating Principles</h4>
        <h5>As a result of our guiding philosophy we will:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Be open and honest.</li>
          <li>Respect confidentiality.</li>

          <li>Manage agreements.</li>
          <li>Maintain a supportive environment.</li>
          <li>Be self-monitoring.</li>
          <li>
            Hold a proper attitude for learning. (We believe no man or woman has
            monopoly of knowledge and wisdom. We are all specialists in some
            areas, generalists in others and very ignorant in yet other areas.
            We are therefore prepared to learn from any individual or
            situation).
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintain a 1% possibility i.e. even if I think I am almost 100 %
            sure I am right on this view, issue etc. I give myself 1 %
            possibility I could be wrong and therefore I am prepared to listen
            to the other viewpoints from my colleague/s and other interested
            parties.
          </li>
          <li>Listen in order to be listened to.</li>
          <li>Work as a team.</li>
          <li>
            Avoid unhealthy competition but engage in fruitful cooperation.
          </li>
          <li>Avoid jumping to conclusions without hearing all the facts.</li>
          <li>Avoid assumptions but get the facts.</li>
          <li>Build on each other’s ideas.</li>
          <li>Strive for fairness and excellence.</li>
          <li>
            Do what we promised we will do and therefore build our integrity.
          </li>
          <li>Be faithful to our promises.</li>
          <li>Ask if unclear and seek help if we need it.</li>
        </ul>
